# Sprint 3: Data Structures and Algorithms II

## Linked Lists
Time complexity for singly linked lists: 
* Insert or delete at beginning: O(1)
* Access a specific index: O(n) (we have to traverse node by node to get to the desired index)
* Insert or delete at a specific index: O(n) 

Other variations:
* Doubly Linked List (each node stores both next and previous pointers)
* Circular Linked List (last node points to the first node rather than None)
